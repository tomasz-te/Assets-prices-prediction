# Assets-prices-prediction



## Goal

The goal of this project is to check whether basic machine learning models can be helpful in predicting future prices of assets such as stocks, commodities and cryptocurrencies. We will choose very different assets for analysis, namely: INTEL (big value), VBK (ETF, small growth), China Yuchai International (micro value), coffee, silver, Bitcoin and Litecoin.

## Conclusions

Generally, the machine learning models we have studied are better at predicting speculative assets.
Without the performance of hyperparameter tuning, the models yield only marginally better results than random choice.
In some settings, we achieve very good predictability and this may be the starting point for further research.
